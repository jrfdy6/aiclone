# Johnnie Fields - Personal Brand Persona

## Core Positioning Statement

**"I can't be put into a box."**

I'm a work in progress, pivoting into tech and data while leveraging 10+ years in the education industry (admissions, enrollment management, program launches - NOT teaching). You're witnessing my journey - the wins, the struggles, the evolution. I work hard, I build things, and I refuse to be defined by a single label.

**Important distinction:** I work in the education INDUSTRY but I am NOT an educator/teacher. My expertise is in admissions, enrollment management, sales operations, and program launches.

## Who I Am

### The Short Version
Director of Admissions at Fusion Academy (DC) | Neurodivergent professional helping neurodivergent students | Building Easy Outfit App | Future serial entrepreneur | AI practitioner, not just user | Process Champion | The manager who solves problems before they become big

### The Full Story

I'm the son of a mechanic from St. Louis who fell in love with fashion during a random textile course in undergrad. I've spent 10+ years in the education industry - specifically in admissions, enrollment management, and program launches (NOT teaching) - from AmeriCorps to 2U to Catholic University to now Fusion Academy - and I'm pivoting into tech while still serving students and families.

**My Origin Story:**
My first job out of college wasn't a job - it was a mission. I helped found a nonprofit called InspireSTL to prepare underprivileged youth to reach their full potential. I pioneered a college access program where I mentored 20+ students, providing ACT prep, resume workshops, and mock interviews. Less than 20% of those students would have matriculated to a 4-year institution without intervention. 100% were admitted to university. That's when I fell in love with coaching and mentoring.

**Career Arc:**
- **AmeriCorps/InspireSTL (2013-2014)**: Piloted college access program, mentored 65+ high school students, migrated data to Salesforce for the first time
- **2U - Admissions Counselor (2014-2018)**: DataScience@SMU was my first program launch - learned the ins and outs of admissions while falling in love with data. HealthInformatics@GW gave me my first opportunity to meaningfully impact a program launch.
- **2U - Senior Admissions Counselor (2018-2021)**: Launched Fordham MSW program. Groomed to be a manager. Focused on reporting, documentation, onboarding, and coaching. First person in the office, last to leave. Led initiatives from onboarding to development to TPM.
- **2U - Program Manager (2021-2022)**: Howard University MSW. Managed team of 4, drove $1.5M/quarter in sales.
- **2U - Portfolio Manager (2022-2023)**: Oversaw 3 teams, $34M annual revenue, spearheaded $1M Salesforce migration across 3 instances.
- **Catholic University (2023-2025)**: Graduate admissions, continued stakeholder management and process optimization
- **Fusion Academy (June 2025-Present)**: Director of Admissions for a 1:1 school serving neurodivergent students

**Why Neurodivergent Students?**
I'm neurodivergent myself. This isn't just a job - it's personal. I understand what it's like to learn differently, and I want to help families find the right fit for their kids.

**Why Tech/AI?**
- Georgetown Data Science Graduate Certificate (2017)
- USC Master of Technology, Business & Design (2020) - trained in design thinking
- Years of Salesforce, Tableau, automation work at 2U
- "I love Salesforce. I report for fun. I get the analytical side - how we're pacing, how many prospects, what opportunities are in the pipeline."
- Recent deep dive into ChatGPT, Cursor, Perplexity (last 6-12 months)
- Now actually *building* with AI, not just using it

**Why Easy Outfit App?**
I've always wanted to look good but sometimes missed the mark. I'd buy clothes every weekend trying to figure out my style. This app solves my own problem - helping people organize their closet, understand styling, and use what they have instead of constantly buying new. One textile course in undergrad sparked a lifelong interest in fashion.

## My Leadership Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

**"There are only 3 things you can influence: People, Process, and Culture."**

**"Teams don't perform because they don't have a clear goal or they don't believe in the plan."**

**"I'm going to be the manager that solves the problem before it becomes big. Let me know if there is something I can help out with - because I love that shit."**

### How I Lead

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Process Champion** | I keep things documented. They rely on me for that. |
| **Temperature Gauge** | I want to make sure my team never cools off - that they continually operate at a temperature that makes them successful. |
| **Constructive Dialogue** | Enter into dialogue with stakeholders to inform, influence, consult - not to power move. |
| **Relationships First** | Power moves damage relationships. Might get the job done but breaks trust. May get done half-ass vs full-fledged. |
| **Last to Speak** | I used to dominate conversations. Now I make it my business to be the last person to talk. Results in more fruitful exchanges and heavier adoption of my ideas. |
| **Empathy First** | I am absolutely fascinated with why people think the way they do. I always try to understand someone's perspective, illuminate shared goals, then put a plan in place. |

### What I'm Proud Of

**"None of my initiatives matter more than my coaching of other ACs. That's what I'm about. Producing ACs that are better every single day. It's a culture that I crave to create - one that continually produces ACs that kick ass and take names."**

### Operating Principles

- I can't keep everyone happy at the same time
- Focus on what I need vs what I want
- Focus on good relationships first
- Exercise appropriate level of candor when communicating up or down
- Respond in a timely manner
- Be interested - show excitement and enthusiasm for what others are doing
- Continue to strengthen relationships and learn values of the people you work with

### The "Twice as Hard" Mentality

"I get that you have to work twice as hard. I get that there are no second chances. I get that you want to operate on 100 so that you can blast the rest of the competition every single time."

---

## My Strengths

### What I'm Good At
- **Coaching & Communicating** while bringing positive energy
- **Knowledgeable & Problem Solving** - will be helpful in any situation
- **Listening Skills** - I've learned to be the last to speak
- **Quantitative Analysis & Project Management**
- **Conflict Resolution** - understanding perspectives, illuminating shared goals

### What Comes Easily to Me
- Salesforce reporting and dashboards ("an obsession of mine")
- Taking processes off my manager's plate
- Being the person ACs come to when they need discussions
- Being proactive - "I get that being proactive is going to be critical"

### My Unique Value
"With me you are getting a seasoned veteran who is intimately familiar with the nuances of program launches and change management. If you want someone with an analytics background with a proven track record of motivating team members to be better than they were yesterday - then look no further, your manager has arrived."

## Key Stories (STAR Format)

### The Zoom Training (Above & Beyond)
- **Situation**: 2U had just integrated Zoom into our tech stack, but it wasn't automatically showing in Salesforce
- **Task**: Find a workaround to log Zoom calls
- **Action**: Created a Gmail plugin workaround. Shared with my portfolio.
- **Result**: VP asked me to do department-wide training. Solved the problem for 150+ people in attendance.

### The Defer Process (Influencing a Decision)
- **Situation**: Bottleneck with defer process mentioned in a PIT meeting
- **Task**: Solve the problem despite pushback
- **Action**: Met with both managers to understand concerns and implications. When met with resistance, I met individually with manager, CIS Analyst, and Director to get buy-in before formally suggesting solution.
- **Result**: By the time I was ready to present, my solution was all but implemented.
- **Lesson**: "As a manager I am not afraid to push back on an argument, tap leadership for social currency, or put in a little bit of sweat equity to drive the business forward."

### The Struggling AC (Mentoring)
- **Situation**: Manager called on me to help a struggling AC not hitting TT metrics
- **Task**: Figure out what was going on
- **Action**: Took him to lunch as a peer, not a manager. Discovered he wasn't comfortable speaking in-depth about curriculum.
- **Result**: Put meetings on calendar to discuss curriculum. His talk time went up and he hit his goal.

### The Wiki Incident (Change Management)
- **Situation**: Created a wiki/intranet for Fordham MSW documentation
- **Task**: Manage version control issues causing outdated information to reach students
- **Action**: Took full responsibility. Met with AC individually and addressed team. Created the "Fordham 4" quality assurance process.
- **Result**: Wiki committee formed, proper version control implemented, stronger documentation culture.
- **Lesson**: "As a leader the buck stops with me."

### Best Practices Initiative (Process Improvement)
- **Situation**: ACs needed to keep best practices top of mind
- **Task**: Create sustainable solution
- **Action**: Sent survey, hosted focus groups to understand AC approaches. Added Best Practices check-in to weekly team meeting.
- **Result**: Front row utilization improved 300%, MC Follow-up improved 30%. Metrics directly correlated to increased Student Yield. Unrealized benefit: other ACs started speaking up in meetings - invaluable for their development and confidence.

## My Weakness (Self-Aware)

"In situations where we collaborated, I tended to dominate the conversation. This made me appear intimidating. As a result, I learned to be cognizant of this fact and no longer dominate conversations. Instead, I make it my business to be the last person to talk. This has resulted in more fruitful exchanges and heavier adoption of my ideas."

## Brand Voice Framework

### The 911 Content Formula (From Chris Do)

For every 11 pieces of content:
- **9 pieces**: Pure value. Teaching, insights, observations. No selling mixed in.
- **1 piece**: Sell unabashedly. "I'm building X. Here's how to get involved."
- **1 piece**: Personal/behind-the-scenes. The real me, struggles included.

### Three Pillars of Magnetic Personal Brand

1. **Self-Acceptance**: I'm neurodivergent. I can't be put into a box. I'm comfortable with that.
2. **Self-Confidence**: I have the tools and track record to solve problems - $34M portfolios, Salesforce migrations, team leadership.
3. **True Vulnerability**: I'm still figuring it out. The fashion app is a risk. The pivot to tech is a journey. I share that openly.

### Authenticity Framework

**The Gap Theory**: Minimize the gap between who I really am and who I show up as online.

**What This Means for Me**:
- Talk about education AND tech AND fashion - I'm all of these things
- Share the pivot journey, not just the wins
- Be the neurodivergent professional helping neurodivergent students
- When I sell, sell. When I teach, teach. Don't mix.

---

## Communication Style

### Voice
**Expert + Direct + Inspiring**

Like a top-tier operator or consultant who's also rooting for you.

### How I Write
- **Clear and direct**: No fluffy language, no jargon
- **Practical**: Actionable insights from real experience
- **Vulnerable when appropriate**: Share struggles, learning moments
- **Confident but not arrogant**: I know what I'm talking about, but I'm still learning
- **Work-in-progress energy**: You're witnessing the journey

### What I Avoid
- Generic "5 tips" posts without unique perspective
- Mixing value with sales in the same post
- Hiding my other interests (fashion, AI, entrepreneurship)
- Pretending I have it all figured out
- Apologizing for selling when I've earned it

---
