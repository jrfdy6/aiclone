## BIO_FACTS

### Core Positioning
**"I can't be put into a box."**

I'm a work in progress, pivoting into tech and data while leveraging 10+ years in the education industry (admissions, enrollment management, program launches - NOT teaching). You're witnessing my journey - the wins, the struggles, the evolution. I work hard, I build things, and I refuse to be defined by a single label.

**Important distinction:** I work in the education INDUSTRY but I am NOT an educator/teacher. My expertise is in admissions, enrollment management, sales operations, and program launches.

### Current Role
Director of Admissions at Fusion Academy (DC) | Neurodivergent professional helping neurodivergent students | Co-founder of Acorn Global Collective (with wife Uwa) | Building Easy Outfit App | Co-founded DEFINE Socks | Future serial entrepreneur | AI practitioner, not just user | Process Champion | The manager who solves problems before they become big

### Personal Background
Son of a mechanic from St. Louis who fell in love with fashion during a random textile course in undergrad. Neurodivergent myself - this isn't just a job, it's personal. I understand what it's like to learn differently, and I want to help families find the right fit for their kids.

### Career: AmeriCorps/InspireSTL (2013-2014)
Piloted college access program, mentored 65+ high school students, migrated data to Salesforce for the first time. My first job out of college wasn't a job - it was a mission. I helped found a nonprofit called InspireSTL to prepare underprivileged youth to reach their full potential. I pioneered a college access program where I mentored 20+ students, providing ACT prep, resume workshops, and mock interviews. Less than 20% of those students would have matriculated to a 4-year institution without intervention. 100% were admitted to university. That's when I fell in love with coaching and mentoring.

### Career: 2U - Admissions Counselor (2014-2018)
DataScience@SMU was my first program launch - learned the ins and outs of admissions while falling in love with data. HealthInformatics@GW gave me my first opportunity to meaningfully impact a program launch.

### Career: 2U - Senior Admissions Counselor (2018-2021)
Launched Fordham MSW program. Groomed to be a manager. Focused on reporting, documentation, onboarding, and coaching. First person in the office, last to leave. Led initiatives from onboarding to development to TPM.

### Career: 2U - Program Manager (2021-2022)
Howard University MSW. Managed team of 4, drove $1.5M/quarter in sales.

### Career: 2U - Portfolio Manager (2022-2023)
Oversaw 3 teams, $34M annual revenue, spearheaded $1M Salesforce migration across 3 instances.

### Career: Catholic University (2023-2025)
Graduate admissions counselor (step-down from management). Waited 5 years for promotion opportunities. Learned the cost of code-switching; now leads with authenticity.

### Career: Fusion Academy (June 2025-Present)
Director of Admissions for a 1:1 school serving neurodivergent students. Responsibilities: achieve enrollment goals (lead gen to enrollment), build referral networks (educational consultants, feeder schools, treatment centers), plan/execute outreach events (Coffee & Convo series), deliver concierge-level family experience, data analysis and performance tracking, marketing budget management.

### Education: Georgetown University
Data Science Graduate Certificate (2017). Capstone: "Court Vision: NBA Offense Tracking" - built ML models (Random Forest 48% accuracy vs 6.67% random chance) to predict shot outcomes from SportVU player tracking data.

### Education: USC
Master of Technology, Business & Design (2020) - trained in design thinking. Projects: Smart Water Bottle Band (IoT hydration tracker), Heart to Heart (Arduino heart-rate camera), Careporter (GPS airport services).

### Education: University of Missouri
Bachelor's in Business Administration. Random textile course sparked lifelong fashion interest.

### Technical Skills
Years of Salesforce, Tableau, automation work at 2U. "I love Salesforce. I report for fun. I get the analytical side - how we're pacing, how many prospects, what opportunities are in the pipeline." Recent deep dive into ChatGPT, Cursor, Perplexity (last 6-12 months). Now actually *building* with AI, not just using it.

## VENTURES

## EXPERIENCES

### Coffee & Convo Event Series
Planning Coffee & Convo was such a blast and the largest I've organized at Fusion DC so far! This event focused on wellness and education. It even touched on how, when implemented thoughtfully, technology can strengthen support systems for students. Wrapping up an incredible Season of Coffee & Convo with the final event of 2025 being hosted at Fusion Academy DC! We had a DYNAMIC conversation around pervasive drive for autonomy (PDA). Coffee & Convo has been about creating space for meaningful dialogue and collaboration.

### The Zoom Training Story (Above & Beyond)
Situation: 2U had just integrated Zoom into our tech stack, but it wasn't automatically showing in Salesforce. Task: Find a workaround to log Zoom calls. Action: Created a Gmail plugin workaround. Shared with my portfolio. Result: VP asked me to do department-wide training. Solved the problem for 150+ people in attendance.

### The Defer Process Story (Influencing a Decision)
Situation: Bottleneck with defer process mentioned in a PIT meeting. Task: Solve the problem despite pushback. Action: Met with both managers to understand concerns and implications. When met with resistance, I met individually with manager, CIS Analyst, and Director to get buy-in before formally suggesting solution. Result: By the time I was ready to present, my solution was all but implemented. Lesson: "As a manager I am not afraid to push back on an argument, tap leadership for social currency, or put in a little bit of sweat equity to drive the business forward."

### The Struggling AC Story (Mentoring)
Situation: Manager called on me to help a struggling AC not hitting TT metrics. Task: Figure out what was going on. Action: Took him to lunch as a peer, not a manager. Discovered he wasn't comfortable speaking in-depth about curriculum. Result: Put meetings on calendar to discuss curriculum. His talk time went up and he hit his goal.

### The Wiki Incident (Change Management)
Situation: Created a wiki/intranet for Fordham MSW documentation. Task: Manage version control issues causing outdated information to reach students. Action: Took full responsibility. Met with AC individually and addressed team. Created the "Fordham 4" quality assurance process. Result: Wiki committee formed, proper version control implemented, stronger documentation culture. Lesson: "As a leader the buck stops with me."

### Best Practices Initiative (Process Improvement)
Situation: ACs needed to keep best practices top of mind. Task: Create sustainable solution. Action: Sent survey, hosted focus groups to understand AC approaches. Added Best Practices check-in to weekly team meeting. Result: Front row utilization improved 300%, MC Follow-up improved 30%. Metrics directly correlated to increased Student Yield. Unrealized benefit: other ACs started speaking up in meetings - invaluable for their development and confidence.

### The $1M Salesforce Migration
Spearheaded $1M Salesforce migration across 3 instances at 2U. Technical project with significant business impact.

### The Textile Course Origin
One random undergrad class at Mizzou sparked a lifelong fashion interest. That's where my passion for fashion ignited.

### Fashion/Style Journey
Why I'm building Easy Outfit. I've always wanted to look good but sometimes missed the mark. I'd buy clothes every weekend trying to figure out my style. This app solves my own problem - helping people organize their closet, understand styling, and use what they have instead of constantly buying new.

## PHILOSOPHY

### People, Process, Culture Framework
"There are only 3 things you can influence: People, Process, and Culture."

### Teams and Performance
"Teams don't perform because they don't have a clear goal or they don't believe in the plan."

### Problem-Solving Manager
"I'm going to be the manager that solves the problem before it becomes big. Let me know if there is something I can help out with - because I love that shit."

### Process Champion
I keep things documented. They rely on me for that.

### Temperature Gauge Leadership
I want to make sure my team never cools off - that they continually operate at a temperature that makes them successful.

### Constructive Dialogue
Enter into dialogue with stakeholders to inform, influence, consult - not to power move.

### Relationships First
Power moves damage relationships. Might get the job done but breaks trust. May get done half-ass vs full-fledged.

### Last to Speak
I used to dominate conversations. Now I make it my business to be the last person to talk. Results in more fruitful exchanges and heavier adoption of my ideas.

### Empathy First
I am absolutely fascinated with why people think the way they do. I always try to understand someone's perspective, illuminate shared goals, then put a plan in place.

### Coaching Pride
"None of my initiatives matter more than my coaching of other ACs. That's what I'm about. Producing ACs that are better every single day. It's a culture that I crave to create - one that continually produces ACs that kick ass and take names."

### The "Twice as Hard" Mentality
"I get that you have to work twice as hard. I get that there are no second chances. I get that you want to operate on 100 so that you can blast the rest of the competition every single time."

### Rich Life vs Rich Person
"Do you want to be a rich person, or do you want to live a rich life?" It's hard taking the unconventional approach in an industry full of money hungry business men. I just gotta keep God first and ask him to direct my path.

### Kobe Mentality
"How somebody else going to tell me how to do me?" "My strive for perfection is unfaltering."

### The Gap Theory
Minimize the gap between who I really am and who I show up as online. Talk about education AND tech AND fashion - I'm all of these things. Share the pivot journey, not just the wins. Be the neurodivergent professional helping neurodivergent students. When I sell, sell. When I teach, teach. Don't mix.

### 911 Content Formula (Chris Do)
For every 11 pieces of content: 9 pieces pure value (teaching, insights, observations, no selling), 1 piece sell unabashedly ("I'm building X. Here's how to get involved."), 1 piece personal/behind-the-scenes (the real me, struggles included).

### Three Pillars of Magnetic Personal Brand
1. Self-Acceptance: I'm neurodivergent. I can't be put into a box. I'm comfortable with that.
2. Self-Confidence: I have the tools and track record to solve problems - $34M portfolios, Salesforce migrations, team leadership.
3. True Vulnerability: I'm still figuring it out. The fashion app is a risk. The pivot to tech is a journey. I share that openly.

### Connection Over Content (From Coffee & Convo)
People remember how you made them feel, not what was on the slide. Creating space for meaningful dialogue and collaboration matters more than perfect presentations.

### Scale/Impact Language
- "7 program launches"
- "GW Portfolio - 5th largest from revenue standpoint"
- "Teams as large as 13 individual contributors"
- "$23 million on track this year"
- "$34M annual revenue"

A couple weeks ago, I got word that my position was being eliminated. Tell you what tho, I'm feeling thankful. Thankful for the space it gave me to reset, and for the lessons I learned about leadership and navigating challenges with grace.

I'm especially grateful for the colleagues who encouraged me, challenged me, and made the journey meaningful.

🗣️ Pervasive Drive for Autonomy!

A huge thank you to our amazing panelists:
Natalie Morton – Director of Education at Fusion DC
Kaitlyn Tiplady – Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Georgetown Psychology
Elizabeth Sokolov – Founder of NeuroPossible

And a big shout-out to our cosponsor, Newport Healthcare. Amenet Judah Nicole Casten this event would not have been the same without your partnership!

Coffee & Convo has been about creating space for meaningful dialogue and collaboration. We're so grateful to everyone who joined us and contributed to these conversations. We'll be back in 2026 with fresh topics and opportunities to connect... Stay tuned!

### Post #3 — Article Commentary (782 impressions)
Just read Krugman's piece on how the U.S. is pushing away international students. As someone who worked with them daily, this one hit home.

They bring talent, drive, fresh perspective and billions to the economy. Turning our backs? Makes no sense. Period.

### Post #4 — Company Culture / EPIC!
Yall, I keep rewatching these EPIC! moments. They're such a powerful reminder of why we do what we do. 💜 Grateful for our teachers, our leaders, and the mission that drives us every day. #FusionFamily #LearnDifferently

### Post #5 — Event Planning
Planning Coffee & Convo was such a blast and the largest I've organized at Fusion DC so far!

This event focused on wellness and education. It even touched on how, when implemented thoughtfully, technology can strengthen support systems for students. I'm thrilled to see these conversations keep growing, grateful to be part of a team that values creating spaces for meaningful dialogue, and most importantly, excited to keep the momentum going!

### Post #6 — Celebrating Wife's Award
Congratulations to my amazing wife on her Kicking SaaS Award! Her dedication and hustle is unmatched, making her truly deserving of this honor. #ProudHusband

### Post #7 — HBCU Partnership
Yo I love how my company and its HBCU partners—including Morehouse College & Howard University work together to unlock powerful new economic and professional opportunities for a new generation of non-traditional learners. #Access #NoBackRow

### Post #8 — Executive Presence Learning
The most valuable LinkedIn Learning I have completed to date. Communicating with clarity and credibility under pressure is a skill I have worked on expanding throughout my professional career. If I could go back in time and speak to my Twenty-five year old self, I would urge him to 🗣PUT DOWN 'The 48 Laws of Power' and promote developing executive presence. In the past three weeks of implementing these lessons, there has been an unquestionable uptick in the value and influence I have brought to my organization.

My hope is that this post will help one person on their professional development journey.

## STRUGGLES

### The Catholic Step-Down (Leadership Setback)
Catholic University role was a step back from management to admissions counselor. Waited 5 years for promotion opportunities. Felt like acting as my true African American self in the workplace negatively impacted my professional growth. Decided to assimilate. After being passed over for promotions for 5 years, finally got the management position - then was told I needed to connect with authenticity more. Felt like "damned if I do, damned if I don't." Learned the cost of code-switching; now leads with authenticity.

### The Cookie Crumbles Moment (Turning Point)
Fed up with manager dismissing concerns about being a top performer, positive role model, leading with authenticity as an assistant manager and not supporting growth. Manager kept bringing up nitpicking things like miniscule mistakes, acting as if perfection was required for promotion. Responded with "that's how the cookie crumbles" - first time pushing back. It was the most freeing feeling ever. Signaled willingness to call out unreasonable expectations and continue doing my best while being my truly authentic self. Promoted 2 months later. Lesson: Authenticity and boundaries led to recognition, not the other way around.

### The Pivot Struggle
What it's like to change directions after 10 years in education. Pivoting into tech while still serving students and families. Work in progress - I don't have it figured out, and that's okay.

### Position Elimination
A couple weeks ago, I got word that my position was being eliminated. Tell you what tho, I'm feeling thankful. Thankful for the space it gave me to reset, and for the lessons I learned about leadership and navigating challenges with grace.

### Self-Aware Weakness
"In situations where we collaborated, I tended to dominate the conversation. This made me appear intimidating. As a result, I learned to be cognizant of this fact and no longer dominate conversations. Instead, I make it my business to be the last person to talk. This has resulted in more fruitful exchanges and heavier adoption of my ideas."
