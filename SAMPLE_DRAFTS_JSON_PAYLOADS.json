        "content": "AI won't replace teachers — but it can amplify the one-to-one care our students need.\n\nIn classrooms with constrained staffing, small automation wins free teachers to do what humans do best: read, observe, and respond. Practical starts I recommend:\n\n1. Use AI to surface early behavioral patterns (5–10 min weekly reports).\n2. Automate administrative notes so teachers spend less time on logging.\n3. Run quick A/B experiments on learning prompts and scale what works.\n\nIf you lead a school, what's one small admin task you'd offload today to reclaim teacher time?",

Design guardrails that protect dignity and context:\n\n• Consent + transparency: students, families, and therapists should know what's tracked.\n• Human-in-the-loop: every recommendation needs a teacher/clinician check.\n• Data minimization: collect only what improves outcomes.\n\nThese are practical, not philosophical.
