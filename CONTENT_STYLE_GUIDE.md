# Content Style Guide

Reference this guide for all content creation.

## Voice and tone

- Write like humans speak. Avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff.
- Be confident and direct. Avoid softening phrases like "I think," "maybe," or "could."
- Use active voice instead of passive voice.
- Use positive phrasing—say what something _is_ rather than what it _isn't_.
- Say "you" more than "we" when addressing external audiences.
- Use contractions like "I'll," "won't," and "can't" for a warmer tone.

## Specificity and evidence

- Be specific with facts and data instead of vague superlatives.
- Back up claims with concrete examples or metrics.
- Highlight customers and community members over company achievements.
- Use realistic, product-based examples instead of `foo/bar/baz` in code.
- Make content concrete, visual, and falsifiable.

## Title creation

- Make a promise in the title so readers know exactly what they'll get if they click.
- Tap into controversial points your audience holds and back them up with data (use wisely, avoid clickbait).
- Share something uniquely helpful that makes readers better at meaningful aspects of their lives.
- Avoid vague titles like "My Thoughts On XYZ." Titles should be opinions or shareable facts.
- Write placeholder titles first, complete the content, then spend time iterating on titles at the end.

## Avoid LLM patterns

- Replace em dashes (—) with semicolons, commas, or sentence breaks.
- Avoid starting responses with "Great question!", "You're right!", or "Let me help you."
- Don't use phrases like "Let's dive into..."
- Skip cliché intros like "In today's fast-paced digital world" or "In the ever-evolving landscape of."
- Avoid phrases like "it's not just [x], it's [y]."
- Avoid self-referential disclaimers like "As an AI" or "I'm here to help you with."
- Don't use high-school essay closers: "In conclusion," "Overall," or "To summarize."
- Avoid numbered lists in cases where bullets work better.
- Don't end with "Hope this helps!" or similar closers.
- Avoid overusing transition words like "Furthermore," "Additionally," or "Moreover."
- Replace "In conclusion" with direct statements.
- Avoid hedge words: "might," "perhaps," "potentially" unless uncertainty is real.
- Don't stack hedging phrases: "may potentially," "it's important to note that."
- Don't create perfectly symmetrical paragraphs or lists that start with "Firstly... Secondly..."
- Avoid title-case headings; prefer sentence casing.
- Remove Unicode artifacts when copy-pasting: smart quotes (""), em-dashes, non-breaking spaces.
- Use `'` instead of `'`.
- Delete empty citation placeholders like "[1]" with no actual source.

## Structure and readability

- Front-load key information in sentences.
- Match vocabulary to reader expertise level.

## Numbers and data

- Spell out numbers one through nine, use numerals for 10+.
- Round large numbers for readability (2.3M vs 2,347,892).
- Always cite sources for statistics.

## Punctuation and formatting

- Use Oxford commas consistently.
- Use exclamation points sparingly.
- Sentences can start with "But" and "And"—but don't overuse.
- Use periods instead of commas when possible for clarity.

## Audience rules

Define the reader before writing. Choose one per piece.

- **School leaders** → clear, operational insights; no jargon; examples from admissions, enrollment, and family scenarios.
- **Referral partners** → emphasize trust signals, outcomes, clarity, and process.
- **EdTech/AI operators** → concrete systems, architecture, and metrics.
- **Fashion tech audience** → practical UX, data, and product design insights.
- **General LinkedIn audience** → personal experience, lessons, wins, and failures with clear takeaways.

Each post must answer: "If this person reads this post, what improves for them?"

## Practitioner voice

Show what you did, why, and what happened.

- Default to: problem → decision → system → outcome → lesson.
- Prioritize real stories over abstract thought.
- Replace advice with templates, scripts, checklists, and workflows.

## Johnnie's voice patterns

### Casual authenticity
- Use "Yall" / "Y'all" naturally (not forced)
- "Tell you what tho" as conversational pivot
- "I'm here for it" for endorsements
- "Makes no sense. Period." for punchy closers
- Phonetic spellings sparingly ("err body" on personal platforms only)

### Engagement hooks
- "Say it with me: 🗣️ [key phrase]!" - gets audience to internalize concept
- "DYNAMIC conversation" - emphasize energy
- "Stay tuned!" / "#staytuned" - build anticipation

### Recognition patterns
- "Big shout out to..." followed by names and titles
- "A huge thank you to our amazing [role]:"
- Tag people with their title/org for context
- "This event would not have been the same without your partnership!"

### Hashtag strategy
- Group thematically at end of post (not inline)
- Mix branded (#FusionFamily, #LearnDifferently) with topical (#Neurodivergence, #MentalHealth)
- Use #stayready, #turnoverchain for career/resilience posts
- Keep to 5-7 hashtags max

### Emoji usage
- Strategic, not excessive
- 🗣️ for "say it with me" hooks
- 💜 for Fusion/education content
- 🔔 for announcements/life updates
- 📸 before photo mentions
- 👉 for CTAs

### Faith references
- Authentic in personal moments, not performative
- "God's got some big things in the works"
- "I just gotta keep God first and ask him to direct my path"
- Use on personal platforms (Facebook); less on LinkedIn unless deeply personal post

### Competitive drive language
- Kobe mentality: "How somebody else going to tell me how to do me?"
- "#yearofexcellence, my strive for perfection is unfaltering"
- "Twice as hard" mentality (reference in persona doc)

### Post structure patterns
- Life updates: 🔔 opener → situation → gratitude → new chapter → hashtags
- Event recaps: Energy statement → "Say it with me" → thank panelists by name/title → cosponsor shoutout → forward look → photos
- Article commentary: Personal connection → sharp opinion → punchy closer ("Makes no sense. Period.")

## Evidence order (strongest to weakest)

Never publish a claim without at least one of the following:

1. Owned data (metrics from your work, anonymized)
2. Systems you built (screenshots, workflows, architecture)
3. Case examples (without naming schools)
4. Market data (link credible sources)
5. Experience-based insights (last resort)

## Post structure rules

- First line must earn the second line. Make it short and visual.
- Use short paragraphs (1–3 lines).
- Every post must contain one of these frameworks:
  - Before → After → How
  - Problem → Mistake → Fix
  - Myth → Truth → Example
  - Story → Insight → Playbook
  - Question → Breakdown → Action

## Hook rules

Hooks must be:
- Specific
- Visual
- Addressing a belief your audience already holds

Examples:
- "Admissions teams are burning out for one reason: too many signals, not enough systems."
- "If you only track inquiries and yield, you're flying blind."
- "AI won't replace admissions work; sloppy process will."

## Helpful clarity

Every post must finish at least one of these:

- **Teach something** (steps, scripts, templates)
- **Reframe something** (misconception → corrected insight)
- **Reveal something** (data, behind-the-scenes system)
- **Challenge something** (wrong industry norm + your alternative)

If it doesn't do one of those, don't post it.

## Personal insight rules

**Share:**
- Lessons
- Failures
- Systems that worked
- Turning points
- Things you changed your mind about

**Avoid:**
- Emotional dumping
- Motivational speeches
- Vague "journey" content
- Content without practical takeaways

## Cross-domain integration

Whenever possible, connect:
- Education operations → AI systems thinking
- Admissions workflows → automation & process design
- Student experience → data mapping & segmentation
- Fashion tech → personalization & UX patterns

This becomes your signature perspective.

## Anti-LLM specifics

- Vary sentence length; avoid perfect patterns.
- Write with imperfections—small asymmetries, non-robotic phrasing.
- Do not restate the question.
- Don't summarize at the end unless necessary.
- Avoid "Therefore/Thus/However" at the start of paragraphs.

## Spiky point rule

Every piece needs one line that:
- States a belief
- Challenges an industry habit
- Or fixes a misconception

Examples:
- "Most enrollment teams don't have a recruitment problem; they have a signal-tracking problem."
- "AI isn't replacing educators; it's replacing guesswork."
- "Admissions teams should operate like product teams—weekly sprints, clear metrics, and structured feedback loops."
