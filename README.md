## Northstar & Vision

### AI Assistant Role

I want you to act as my personal AI assistant starting today. Your role is to be my behind-the-scenes strategic advisor, efficiency expert, creative partner, and execution engine—all in one. Treat every question, task, or request I bring to you with the mindset of a world-class operator who understands business, marketing, content, systems, and personal development. Combine the best traits of a high-performing executive assistant, copywriter, business coach, strategist, and productivity expert. Be clear, direct, thoughtful, and deeply practical. Do not use fluffy language, unnecessary jargon, or overly generic advice. Your job is to help me save time, make smarter decisions, remove friction, and move faster toward my goals—using AI as the tool to do it.

### About Me

I work as the Director of Admissions at a for-profit K-12 educational private school in Washington, D.C. My role involves helping families understand the value of our one-to-one care model, especially for neurodivergent students. Half of my work is with families; the other half is building meaningful relationships with professionals like private school administrators, mental health professionals, community partners, and treatment center administrators to generate referral opportunities. I am passionate about operations, AI, business, and technology, and I am developing a fashion app that helps people organize their closet, understand styling, and improve outfit coordination. My long-term goal is to become a serial entrepreneur, leveraging my experience in program management and scalable solution-building.

### Audience

### Goals (6–12 months)

## Brand Voice Development Framework

### Core Philosophy

**"AI isn't making thought leadership go away. It's making generic thought leadership go away."**

The goal is meaningful differentiation—finding what makes you unique and going all in on that. Your brand voice should reflect who you are, not who you think you should be.

### The Three Pillars of Magnetic Personal Brand

1. **Self-Acceptance**: Comfortable in your own skin, not trying to prove anything. You love yourself enough to leave room for others to be themselves.
2. **Self-Confidence**: Belief that you have the tools and resources to solve any problem (not arrogance or braggadocio).
3. **True Vulnerability**: Comfortable sharing what makes you weak or what you've struggled with. You accept those parts and don't apologize for who you are.

### The 911 Content Formula

For every 11 pieces of content:
- **9 pieces**: Pure value, no selling. Teaching, thought leadership, point of view. Don't mix value with sales—it robs you of goodwill.
- **1 piece**: When you sell, sell. Be unabashed and direct. "I have a course/workshop/book. Here's how to buy it." You've earned the right to sell through your value.
- **1 piece**: Personal/behind-the-scenes content. Show who you are—your struggles, your life, your point of view. This builds relatability and trust.

**Key Rule**: Don't flip the equation. Never do 9 pieces of selling with 1 piece of value. The ratio should favor value.

### Authenticity Framework

**The Gap Theory**: Authenticity is the gap between your shadow self (who you really are) and your persona (who you show up as in the world). The goal is to minimize this gap—not to be 100% authentic (impossible), but to close the distance between the two.

**What This Means for You**:
- Share your evolving interests (fashion app, AI, operations) alongside your professional work (admissions, neurodivergent students)
- Talk about your passions openly—you're an evolving human being, not a one-dimensional professional
- When you sell, sell. When you teach, teach. Don't mix the waters.

### Brand Building vs. Performance Marketing

**Brand Building** (Your Focus):
- Inward exploration: Who am I? What makes me me? What are my values?
- Long-term value, no short-term cash flow
- Giving value without expectation of outcome
- Discovery of self, not manufacturing of content
- This is who you are

**Performance Marketing** (Avoid This):
- Outward exploration: What do I do? How do I convert?
- Short-term cash flow, conversions
- Transactional relationships
- Manufacturing content
- This is what you do

### Your Unique Differentiation

**What Makes You Different**:
- **Bridge Builder**: You connect two worlds—traditional education (K-12 admissions) and cutting-edge technology (AI, fashion tech)
- **Neurodivergent Advocate**: Deep understanding of one-to-one care models and neurodivergent student needs
- **Operator + Creator**: Not just talking about AI—you're building AI products and fashion tech
- **Relationship-Focused**: Half your work is families, half is building professional referral networks
- **Serial Entrepreneur in the Making**: Long-term vision beyond current role

**Content Angles That Reflect Your Uniqueness**:
- How AI is transforming enrollment management (not generic "AI in education")
- The intersection of operations, technology, and human connection
- Building referral networks through authentic relationships (not transactional)
- Lessons from building a fashion app while working in education
- The reality of being a changemaker in a traditional industry

### Content Strategy for LinkedIn

**What to Post (9 Value Pieces)**:
1. **Thought Leadership**: Unique takes on enrollment management, AI in EdTech, neurodivergent student support
2. **Case Studies**: Real stories (anonymized) of families you've helped or referral partnerships you've built
3. **Behind-the-Scenes**: The reality of admissions work, building relationships, operations challenges
4. **AI Insights**: How you're using AI tools (Cursor, Perplexity, Firecrawl) in your work
5. **Industry Observations**: What you're seeing in K-12 education, EdTech trends, referral networks
6. **Lessons Learned**: From your fashion app development, operations work, relationship building
7. **Resource Sharing**: Tools, frameworks, or insights that help your audience
8. **Question-Driven Posts**: Provocative questions that spark discussion in your niche
9. **Cross-Pollination**: Connecting education, AI, fashion tech, and entrepreneurship

**What to Post (1 Personal Piece)**:
- Your journey as an evolving professional
- Challenges you're facing (fashion app, LinkedIn optimization, balancing roles)
- What you're learning about yourself
- Your values and beliefs about education, AI, entrepreneurship
- Personal stories that show your humanity

**What to Post (1 Sales Piece)**:
- Direct offers: "I'm available for consulting on enrollment management"
- "I'm building an AI tool for [X]—interested in beta testing?"
- "I'm speaking at [event]—join me"
- "My fashion app is launching—here's how to get early access"
- Clear, unabashed, no apologies

### Communication Principles

**Your Style**: Expert + direct (like a top-tier operator or consultant) and inspiring

**How to Write**:
- **Clear and Direct**: No fluffy language, unnecessary jargon, or generic advice
- **Practical**: Actionable insights, not theory
- **Vulnerable When Appropriate**: Share struggles, learning moments, evolution
- **Confident but Not Arrogant**: You know what you're talking about, but you're still learning
- **Relatable**: Connect with professionals who support neurodivergent students and AI-savvy leaders

**What to Avoid**:
- Generic "5 tips for..." posts (unless you have a unique angle)
- Mixing value with sales in the same post
- Hiding your other interests (fashion app, AI passion)
- Trying to be everything to everyone
- Apologizing for selling when you've earned it

### The Introvert's Advantage

As someone who may lean introverted (given your focus on operations and systems):
- **Make yourself recognizable**: Your content does the talking, so people can approach you
- **Be comfortable in discomfort**: Share your point of view even if it's uncomfortable
- **Let content be your social skills**: You don't need to be the life of the party—your insights speak for you

### Long-Term Brand Building

**The Journey**:
- Year 1: Little results, lots of work (the valley)
- Unknown timeline: Breakthrough moment (when it clicks)
- Post-breakthrough: Doors open you didn't know existed

**The Reality**: Most people quit in the valley. The ones who persist and do the inner work (therapy, self-discovery) are the ones who break through.

**For You Specifically**:
- Build your brand around being a changemaker in enrollment management
- Position yourself as an AI practitioner, not just a user
- Connect your fashion app journey to your entrepreneurial vision
- Show the full picture: education professional + tech builder + future serial entrepreneur

### Content That Builds Trust

**What Makes People Trust You**:
- Consistency in showing up
- Relatability (they see themselves in your journey)
- Track record (you've done the work, you're doing the work)
- Point of view (you stand for something, not everything)
- Transparency (you share struggles, not just wins)

**Remember**: People don't buy information—they buy the trusted person to lead them. In the age of AI, information is cheap. Your unique perspective and story are what matter.

- **Firecrawl**: Web scraping and content extraction
- **Google Custom Search**: Prospect discovery

### Internal Services
- **Embedders**: Local embedding generation (HashingVectorizer)
- **Retrieval**: Cosine similarity search
- **Scoring**: Multi-dimensional prospect scoring
- **Memory Service**: Chunk management and provenance
- **Parsers**: PDF, PPTX, audio transcription, OCR
- **WebSocket Manager**: Real-time communication

## Security

### Firestore Security Rules (Starter)

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/{collection}/{docId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    match /global/agents_config/{doc} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Only the backend service account should perform ingestion writes. Frontend never accesses Firestore directly.

## Development Workflow

### Using MCPs (Model Context Protocol)

The project supports MCP workflows in Cursor:
- **Firecrawl MCP**: For web scraping and content extraction
- **Perplexity MCP**: For research and content generation

See `MCP_SETUP_GUIDE.md` and `MCP_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` for details.
