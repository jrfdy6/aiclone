## Section 1: Positioning & Posts

### Fundamental Requirements
**Question:** "What are the fundamental things you need in place to start positioning yourself for opportunities and posting thought leadership to increase visibility?"

### Niche & Clear Offer
**Key Principle:** "I realised very early on that the riches are in the niches when branding online"

**Self-Reflection Questions:**
- Who is the exact leader you serve and why should they trust your perspective?
- What insights will you share that make executives return to your profile?
- What gaps in your industry keep leaders stuck and how do you fill them?
- If you can't state your niche + offer in one line, who's helping you sharpen it?

### ATS-AI Optimized LinkedIn Profile
**Two Focus Areas:**

1. **Corp Exec & Board Roles**
   - Optimize profile for Applicant Tracking Systems and AI
   - Include relevant keywords and positioning

2. **Client Attraction & Sales**
   - Example: Denise (DesMarais) Hayman - "Chief Revenue Officer & Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategic Advisor"
   - Keywords: Sales Leadership, GTM Strategy, Growth Strategy, Business Value Creation

### Posting Strategy - Common Mistakes

**Past Mistakes:**
- Talking to audiences who didn't see expertise for a full-time role or business service as a priority
- Trying to earn trust that hadn't yet been earned
- Overlooking the warm leads already in front of them

**The Results of These Mistakes:**
- "Not now."
- "Maybe later."
- "I'll think about it."

**The Shift:**
- Stopped posting for everyone
- Focused on specific audiences
