## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: Query Structure
❌ **Unlikely** - Tried many variations including very simple queries

### Hypothesis 2: Google Custom Search Limitations
✅ **Likely** - Mom groups primarily exist on:
- Facebook Groups (blocked)
- Meetup.com (may be blocked/filtered)
- Nextdoor (blocked)
- Private/informal networks

### Hypothesis 3: Search Volume
✅ **Likely** - There may simply not be enough public websites with:
- PTA president contact information
- Mom group leader contact information
- Publicly scrapeable parent network contacts

### Hypothesis 4: Geographic Specificity
⚠️ **Possible** - Washington DC area may have fewer public parent group resources

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Accept Manual Curation (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Mom groups are inherently informal/private
- Quality over quantity for this category
- 7/8 categories at 100% is excellent

**Cons**:
- Requires manual research
- Less scalable

### Option 2: Target Alternative Sources
- **PTA Directory Websites**: Manual list of school district PTA directories
- **Community Center Directors**: Public community center staff pages
- **Parenting Blog/Website Owners**: Bloggers who run parent resources
- **School Counselor Directories**: Some districts list parent liaison contacts

### Option 3: Expand Beyond "Mom Groups"
- Include "Youth Program Directors"
- Include "After-School Program Coordinators"  
- Include "Community Organization Leaders"

### Option 4: LinkedIn Integration (Future)
- LinkedIn has many parent group organizers
- Would require different scraping approach
- Higher value targets
